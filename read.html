<p style="font-family:courier; font-size:20"> Hello people who stumbled onto my page, I have decided to start a blog of all the books I've read (if I can remember them all lol) and what I personally thought about them. This is more of a for me thing, but if it helps you find a book, I'm happy to have helped you along the way somehow.(Done for the purpose of remembering how to code.)</p> 

<style>
table {
    font-family: courier;
    font-size: 24px;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
}
td, th {
    border: 1px solid #A09FA0;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 8px;
}
tr:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: #ffffff;
}

    <td> ARROWS</td>
    <td>MELISSA GORZELANCZYK</td>
    <td>BEST BOOK I'VE READ THIS YEAR 2018. IT WAS ROMANCE AND JUST BEAUTIFUL. The main character, Karma, bothered me sometimes, but it helped how well it was tied into the story. I would honestly love this to be turned into a movie, but with everything in the story to be as accurate on screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES</td>
    <td>JOHN GREEN</td>
    <td>Wasn't as good as I has hoping it would be. I feel that the only reason I finshed reading the book was for the pure purpose that I had already started it and just wanted to end it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>THE LAST STAR (THE 5TH WAVE #3)</td>
    <td>RICK YANCEY</td>
    <td>To be honest, I picked off where I had last read it which was over a year, so I was very lost and again reading it just to be done with it. It didn't amaze me as much as I wanted it to, and I didn't know how to feel about the ending since it was just open ended, which I personally don't like.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SIMON VS THE HOMO SAPIENS AGENDA</td>
    <td>BECKY ALBERTALLI</td>
    <td>Such a cute same-sex story. I absolutely loved it and would definetely  recommend to read it. Still haven't seen Love,Simon but hopefully that will change soon. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>THE MAZE RUNNER</td>
    <td>AUTHOR</td>
    <td>Still reading, and hope to finish before my birthday. I don't know if I will read the entire series, but I hope I get hooked.</td>
